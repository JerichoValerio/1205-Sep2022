For me personally I shall remember him as an abidingly loyal client.  1111111111111111111112 33333333333 
As well as being a wonderful actor, he was forensically intelligent, 
brilliantly witty and after 40 years of being proud to be called his agent, I shall miss him.

He is survived by his sister Annie Rae, his children Spencer and Alice and their mother Rhona Gemmell. 
They would like to thank the medical staff at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert for their care and diplomacy.
